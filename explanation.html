        <h2>RC4 encryption algorithm</h2>
        <p>
            RC4, or Rivest Cipher 4, is a proprietary cipher owned by RSA DSI and another design by Ron Rivest. It is a simple yet effective byte-oriented stream cipher with a variable key size, widely used in SSL/TLS for web security and WEP/WPA for wireless security. RC4 is a variable key-size stream cipher. The cipher uses a permutation and two 8-bit index pointers to generate the keystream. </p>
            <p>The Key Scheduling Algorithm (KSA) performs the permutation, which is then fed into a Pseudo-Random Generation Algorithm (PRG), which creates a bitstream. The pseudorandom stream that the RC4 generates is as long as the plaintext stream. The stream and plaintext are then combined using the Exclusive Or (X-OR) operation to create the ciphertext. </p>

        <h2>A5-1 encryption algorithm </h2>
        <p>
            A5/1, a stream cipher employed for securing mobile phone calls to base stations, utilizes a trade-secret algorithm that was reverse-engineered and published. It generates a 114-bit sequence through three Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSR) of sizes 19, 22, and 23 bits for XOR-ing with the data within a GSM frame.
